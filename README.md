## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a transaction-decoder integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Executive Summary

A **transaction-decoder** is a critical software component that acts as a universal interpreter and data normalizer. Its primary role is to take the raw, often inconsistent data formats (APIs, WebSocket streams) from exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken and translate them into a single, standardized, and actionable data model. This enables automated trading systems and portfolio managers to function seamlessly across multiple platforms without needing custom logic for each exchange.

### The Core Problem: Exchange Data Heterogeneity

Major exchanges provide similar functionalities (e.g., market data, order placement, account balances) but through vastly different interfaces and data structures.

| Feature | Binance Example | Coinbase Example | Kraken Example | The Problem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ticker Symbol** | `BTCUSDT` | `BTC-USD` | `XBTUSD` | Same asset pair, different naming. |
| **Order Book Depth** | `"bids": [["price", "qty"], ...]` |
